# The Solution
Probably overly complex, rough, with mistakes and unreadable. 
It does have some tests for the (most likely) infamous form, that does not do well on validation.
Some of them do fail, but they should.

##About the form
It is clear why it is a gem for a tester. Field validations are real bad,
produces lots of type errors, then some other error about missing library, 
that I even included in test. It does validate some of the stuff, but pretty 
much without any feedback to the end user. It needs some work to be usable.
Not being able to send it for testing is also an obstacle.
I for sure did once. Sorry...
