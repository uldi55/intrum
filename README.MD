# The Solution
Probably overly complex, rough, with mistakes and unreadable. 
It does have some tests for the (most likely) infamous form, that does not do well on validation.
Some of them do fail, but they should. Also, sorry about the comments.

## About the form
It is clear why it is a gem for a tester. Field validations are real bad,
produces lots of type errors, then some other error about missing library, 
that I even included in test. It does validate some of the stuff, but pretty 
much without any feedback to the end user. It needs some work to be usable.
Not being able to send it for testing is also an obstacle.
I for sure did once. Sorry...

##How to run the tests
Running the tests is quite simple. Just get the solution and use the test runner to run them.
They are built in a way so that all tests should be run always...
Second test continues where first left and so on.
One or two tests will fail (usually 2) but it should show the general idea.
Tests are meant to catch issues after all.
